#Case for IBRD Loans & IDA Credit/Grants as Big Data:
The World Bank datasets selected qualifies as a use case for big data because it satisfies one of the differentiating Vâ€™s of big data (Volume, Variety & Velocity). The datasets provided by the World Bank each provide 1.2 M rows, 2.4M rows in total which passes the volume threshold required to be specified as big data which can be analyzed through a data engineering pipeline such as the ones we have built out in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Though its velocity is not real-time, for financial data it updates monthly which is satisfactory when looking at the activity for loans, credits, and grants from an organization such as the World Bank. 

#Use Case for IBRD Loans & IDA Credit/Grants
The World Bank is an intriguing organization due to its membership-oriented approach to appropriating funds to developed and developing countries nations. One thing that is not readily available through news articles or datasets on websites like Google Public Data is the borrowing tendencies of nations as well as what developing nations are securing the bulk of the grants provided by the World Bank. 
When it comes to creating a solution to dive into these areas of interest a solution built within a cloud storage provider like Amazon Web Services is a perfect fit. The data itself from the World Bank is available in a variety of formats such as CSV (Comma Separated Values), RDF (Rich Data Format), XML (eXtensible Markup Language) or via an API (Application Programming Interface).
